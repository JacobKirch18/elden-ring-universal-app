## Description

This is a companion app for elden ring. It features a list
of all bosses with their photos, along with a compendium that
lists all the bosses the user has marked as defeated. Once a
boss is added to the compendium, all the detailed information
about a boss can be seen.

This makes use of the Elden Ring API found here:
