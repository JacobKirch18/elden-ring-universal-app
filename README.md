## Description

This is a companion app for elden ring. It features a list
of all bosses with their photos, along with a compendium that
lists all the bosses the user has marked as defeated. Once a
boss is added to the compendium, all the detailed information
about a boss can be seen. There are also radio buttons to keep
track of what New Game+ you are on. 

This makes use of the Elden Ring API found here:
